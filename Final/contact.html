 <h2>FAQ</h2>
 <div class="contact-container">
  <form action="action_page.php">
  <p>Q1. When and how will my order ship?</p><br>
  <p>A1. Please allow at least one week for delivery. Gift-A-BOX boxes from our shop typically process within 1-3 business days and are shipped via USPS Priority Mail or UPS Ground. If you need your order on or by a specific date please email us at hello@giftAbox.com and we will try our best to make it happen! Currently, we only ship within the United States. If you are looking to ship outside of the United States, please contact us for a custom quote.</p><br>
  <p>Q2. How will my gift(s) be packaged and wrapped?</p><br>
  <p>A2. All of our gifts are packaged in high quality paper or wood slide top boxes and are tied with ribbon and/or seasonal accents. Please refer to the specific listing for details on how the outside of your gift will be wrapped. If you have something else in mind, please add this comment at checkout. Note that we occasionally (beautifully) wrap glass and breakable items to protect them for transport.</p><br>
  <p>Q3. Can I customize my gift box?</p><br>
  <p>A3. Of course! Want to swap out an item, hit a certain price point, or create a memorable one-of-a-kind gift? Send us a note at hello@giftAbox.com to get started. Check out our <a href="custom.html"><b>CUSTOM PAGE</b></a> for more information or our Gallery for inspiration.</p><br>
  <p>Q4. Can I add a personalized note?</p><br>
  <p>A4. You bet! Please write your personal note or sentiment at checkout. You can find this area under "order notes" on the shopping cart page. If you prefer to write your own message, please add a note to include a blank card with your gift. You can always email us at hello@giftAbox.com to add any notes to your order.</p><br>
  <p>Q5. Do you offer gifting services for businesses and industry professionals?</p><br>
  <p>A5. This is our specialty! Please visit our <a href="corporate.html"><b>CORPORATE PAGE</b></a> for more info.</p><br>
  <p>Q6. My order is a gift. Can you make sure not to include any packing slip or receipt in my delivery?</p><br>
  <p>A6. Of course. We will only include hard copies of receipts and/or packing lists by request.</p><br>
  <p>Q7. What is your return policy?</p><br>
  <p>A7. Due to the time and attention to detail we take in assembling your gift, all sales are final. We take great care in making sure your gifts get to you just as pretty as they left us. If there has been damage to your item(s) in transit, please notify us immediately at hello@giftAbox.com.</p><br>

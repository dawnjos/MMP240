  <h1>Yara Shahidi Gets Real About Her Future, Activism, and Harvard.</h1>

                <p><b>Yara Shahidi</b> might be one of the most recognizable young Hollywood stars, but the grounded and newly-minted 18 year old isn’t letting fame change the fact that she’s still a teenager learning and growing in the world. Yara Shahidi may not seem like a typical teen, but that just means the world needs to change how it thinks about teens.</p>

                <p>The Black-ish actress spoke candidly with writer <b>Sarah Mcleod</b> for <b>HIPSTAR’s</b> May 2018 issue, discussing everything from identity, race, handling fame, “wokeness,” and Twitter comments.</p><br>

                <p>Sure, Shahidi stars as the oldest kid in the Johnson family in <b>ABC's Black-ish</b> and in the spinoff series <b>Grown-ish</b>, built around her character, Zoey. And yes, former first lady <b>Michelle Obama</b> wrote her a letter of recommendation for college. Shahidi, 18, is attending Harvard after taking a gap year and plans to double major in sociology and African-American studies.</p>

                <p>But when you ask Shahidi what she sees herself doing in the next few years, she says she wants to be "politically adjacent." It's not as odd as it sounds when you think about her generation's interest in social and political issues and their use of social media and tech to get their voices heard.</p>

                <p>"What I love about the internet is that not only is it a platform for our voices to be shared, it's a platform to disseminate information," says Shahidi, the child of a mom who's African-American and Choctaw and an Iranian-American dad. "It has allowed us to claim our own history, and more than that, share our own history with each other — especially in a world where so many of our histories and stories have been intentionally left out."</p>

                <p>Her views explain why Shahidi celebrated her 18th birthday by hosting a get-out-the-vote party and encouraging her friends to register in time for this year's midterm elections. It's also why she started Eighteen x '18, an online platform to help teens learn about the issues affecting them. That includes creating videos on topics they're passionate about and making it easy for them to share their ideas and ask questions.</p><br>

               <article>
                <h5>Let's talk about Eighteen x '18. What was the idea behind it?</h5>
                <p>It started after the unrest of the 2016 general election. So many of my peers, including me, couldn't vote. It really stemmed from this idea of how do we engage in our government systems? How do we make sure we stay informed, especially when you are either a new voter or somebody who hadn't voted yet?</p>
           
                <p>So many people are turning 18 or 19 this year. This will be their first year of voting. How do we make sure we disseminate information properly and also answer those simple questions — like, "If I'm in college where do I go to vote? Where is my polling place? What's an absentee ballot?"</p>
           
                <h5>You also call Eighteen x '18 a creative platform with an open invitation to other young adults. What do you hope they'll share?</h5>
                <p>At a certain point, we'll be able to start disseminating videos that aren't all from me, but from my peers across the country. A lot of times with politics, if it doesn't affect you, it seems very theoretical and foreign. I feel like it will help us be more informed voters.

                One thing that's already been happening that I love is [people] sending in their own questions. I feel like so much of this is supposed to be a relationship based on reciprocity. We want it to really answer something you are worried about.</p>
           
                <h5>Some people have been telling young activists they shouldn't be speaking out. What do you think about that?</h5>
                <p>Politics affect every single person who exists, and United States politics affect the entire world. So this idea that we shouldn't have a voice — or that our opinion is invalid — is invalid in and of itself. The best that we can do is be as informed as possible. When they say, "Well, why do you even believe that?" [You can say] "Well, here are the facts, and this is why I came to this conclusion."</p>

                <h5>So your online platform plays into that?</h5>
                <p>What I love about the internet is it's a platform for our voices to be shared and a platform to disseminate information. It's a platform to really understand the stories and the narratives that aren't included. Information was very formal in the way it used to be disseminated. If it's in a textbook, how did it get into the textbook? What was the level of vetting that it had to go through?</p>

                <p>This is a way in which we can share personal stories firsthand, to be our own sources [of truth]. Now of course you have to be wary and you have to do your own personal checking. But it has allowed us to claim our own history, and more than that, share our own history with each other — especially in a world in which so many of our histories and stories have been intentionally left out.</p>
                
                <h5>Is there something about tech you dislike?</h5>
                <p>I feel like right now we're enduring a lack of transparency. So many people in my generation are a little wary [about] the algorithms that really determine what we see and when we see it. And then there's the other end of it: How unfiltered it is — it really can be a place where you get your feelings hurt.</p>

                <h5>You'll be a freshman at Harvard this fall and you've said you want to be "politically adjacent." Can you tell us what that means?</h5>
                <p>I know for a fact that I don't want to be on Capitol Hill or a senator or anyone in that kind of position. But I still want to be able to contribute, I think, in the nonprofit world and in the — for lack of a better term —professional activist world. There are so many ways to make policy changes. And if anything, there's more freedom in doing so because you're not dealing with certain structures and bureaucracies. That's kind of the realm that I know I want to live in. I don't know exactly the details of it.</p>
                
                <h5>You're now the star of Grown-ish, in which your character from Black-ish — Zoey — heads off to college. What can you say about it?</h5>
                <p>Well, we're about to go back to shoot season 2, which I'm really excited about. They're having storylines relating to how Zoey relates to the world, and I love the duality that's addressed in certain episodes: the image she projects to the world through her social media, through her being a quote-unquote public figure, and then her personal life. Sometimes they line up and are fabulous, and sometimes they aren't, but it's really cool. In season 2, we really get to explore more of who she is now that we have the environment established and we know who her gang of friends are.</p>

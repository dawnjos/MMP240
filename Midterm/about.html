    College-application season is just about done, much to the imminent relief of a specific breed of teens with well-plotted career goals, joiner mentalities, and a hearty stomach for creative exaggeration. And, as any properly panicked applicant knows, students today need unique interests to separate them from a pack of similarly high-achieving data-entry experts. Yara Shahidi clearly read the relevant message boards, because the Black-ish actress has Michelle Obama in her back pocket. Shahidi revealed to HIPSTAR Magazine that Obama wrote her a letter of recommendation for colleges. And the mentorship is real, because the former FLOTUS went far beyond your average overworked high-school guidance counselor, also giving Shahidi a “go get ’em, tiger” back-rub as encouragement for Shahidi’s AP exams. Shahidi previously shared plans to apply to Harvard and other top schools, so with Obama’s endorsement, who’s to say? She might just have a shot.</p>

    <p><span class="first-character atw">I</span>t’s been three days since Zoey Johnson — the oldest child in ABC’s “black-ish” family, played by Yara Shahidi — departed for the fictional Cal U. And already, her father is a shell of a man, begging her to come home for the weekend.

    “Whyyyyyy???” Anthony Anderson, as the paterfamilias Dre, wails from the confines of his walk-in closet. “It hurts so bad.”
    “What hurts so bad, Dad?” Zoey asks with equal parts loving tolerance and eye-rolling disdain.
    “My soul!” he whimpers.

    But Zoey? She’s definitely too cool for school in “grown-ish,” a spinoff of her own having its premiere on Wednesday, Jan. 3, on Freeform. Until she’s not.
    We’re not. “In the very first scene, she is like every other moment: extremely confident in who she is and still kind of annoyed by her father,” Ms. Shahidi said. “But pretty immediately it’s revealed that she has no clue what she’s doing in college, and we kept Zoey amid that crisis. I think that’s what the show really is about: how one forms relationships and their personal ethics in this new time.”

    It’s a time that Ms. Shahidi, who turns 18 in February, is preparing for during a gap year before heading to Harvard. “I’ve been acting since kindergarten,” she said, “so I found it really important to take my time in this next step of my journey and appreciate it.” </p>

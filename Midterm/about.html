                Like <b>TEENVOGUE</b> and many other magazine under Conde Nast publication it includes stories about fashion but in HIPSTAR we take it up a level and also focus on the current events of our country and the world.</p> 
                <p>The magazine has cut back on its print distribution in favor of online content, which has grown significantly. Our magazine has also expanded its focus from fashion and beauty to include politics and current affairs.</p> 
                <p>HIPSTAR magazine offers a voice to the young who have an opinion and need somewhere to voice it. That is why we feature young people who has an impact on society and striving to make changes.
                HIPSTAR is mostly an online entertainment and news magazine with one purpose “our future generation.”</p>

    College-application season is just about done, much to the imminent relief of a specific breed of teens with well-plotted career goals, joiner mentalities, and a hearty stomach for creative exaggeration. And, as any properly panicked applicant knows, students today need unique interests to separate them from a pack of similarly high-achieving data-entry experts. Yara Shahidi clearly read the relevant message boards, because the Black-ish actress has Michelle Obama in her back pocket. Shahidi revealed to HIPSTAR Magazine that Obama wrote her a letter of recommendation for colleges. And the mentorship is real, because the former FLOTUS went far beyond your average overworked high-school guidance counselor, also giving Shahidi a “go get ’em, tiger” back-rub as encouragement for Shahidi’s AP exams. Shahidi previously shared plans to apply to Harvard and other top schools, so with Obama’s endorsement, who’s to say? She might just have a shot.

    <p><span class="first-character ny">T</span>HAT TWINGE OF worry. That occasional, sudden-onset widening-gyre sensation. It’s hard not to experience a bit of anxiety at the world’s recent technological upheavals—the endless stream of hacks, leaks, and cyberattacks; the whiplash advances in artificial intelligence and automation; the constant fear and loathing stoked by @socialmedia; and the Hierony­mus Bosch spectacle that is democracy in the age of flying monkeys and fake news. It might be different if the leaders of the tech industry were offering reassurances, but instead we’ve got Tesla founder Elon Musk warning about the “existential risk” that AI poses to humanity, Y Combinator president Sam Altman expressing his certainty that automation is coming for millions of jobs, and countless tech moguls reportedly buying up “apocalypse insurance” in the form of New Zealand real estate. And if those rich white men have their hair on fire, God help the rest of the world racing to set up 2FA on Gmail .

    The only person who isn’t spooked, it seems, is Mark Zuckerberg. And somehow it’s just as hard to trust folks like him, who insist with an imploring smile—while busily rewiring the social fabric of human civilization—that everything’s going to be great.</p>

    <p><span class="first-character atw">D</span>EAR MONICA—THAT’S how you start a letter, with a salutation, I’d almost forgot.

    Monica, my dear, my love, my girl woman pony heart—I’ve written you a letter! On paper! With pen! A letter!!!

    (How many exclamation points do I have to use nowadays to come off as normal???)

    Hope you can read my scribbles.

    Now I know what you’re thinking: You’re thinking that if I’ve gone to all the trouble of cursiving and sending you a Marriott Marquis stationery/Marriott Marquis ballpoint letter all the way from the middle of my business trip to New York, I must have something serious, something grievous, to tell you, because letters are for serious grievous occasions, like Latin is for funerals.

    In my mind, I can see you sitting down now, green couch, den, and preparing yourself with a breath to hear that I’ve been diagnosed with over 70,000 incurable rare cancers, or that I’m leaving you for someone else, but don’t worry. Or do worry, but about yourself: Because while I’m fairly sure that I’m in decent health, I’m just as certain that, at the end of this, you’ll be the one leaving me.

    OK. My computer. It seems as if my computer has been hacked and all the crap on it, or all the crap related to all the accounts related to it, or whatever—everything I’ve ever done on it—has been made public.

    I was alerted to this fact by a phone call from HR—apparently, the attack has struck throughout the company. Striking most of management too, along with all the road reps. I’m just putting that out there, the extent of the attack, not so as to evade responsibility by spreading guilt or victimhood around but just as reassurance, to reassure you more than myself: I’m not alone.

    We’re not.</p>
